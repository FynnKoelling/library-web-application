# library-web-application
by Fynn Linus KÃ¶lling and Kai Fehrcke

Implementation of a web application for a library website. The application contains several pages with functions such as registration and log-in options, the creation, search and rating of books, and wish lists. All functions are listed in the table below. AJAX applications were written to implement user-related actions. A MySQL database runs in the background.

# Important:
Please note that all text on the pages is written in German. However, the code is commented in English.
To run the application, XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html) must be installed and the Apache and MySQL modules must be started. The repository must be stored under C:\xampp\htdocs. The databases in the backend can be accessed in any web browser via http://localhost/phpmyadmin. Before starting the application, a new database with the name **mybib** must be created there! The application can then be accessed in a web browser via http://localhost/repository-name/start.php. It is necessary to call **start.php** first when starting the application for the first time in order to create the necessary tables!

The application comes with admin access. The access details are: Email: **admin@bib.de** Password: **12345**. The admin has special rights such as creating new books or organising user accounts.

## Folder structure:
- Repository: HTML/PHP pages, CSS file and subfolders js, php and pic.
- Subfolder js: Pure Javascript files
- Subfolder php: Pure PHP files
- Subfolder pic: Images for the website
